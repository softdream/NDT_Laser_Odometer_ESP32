## NDT_Laser_Odometer_ESP32
An implementation of Laser Odometer in ESP32 by NDT method.</br>
Laser odometer can be used for robot positioning and mapping.The code in this repo implemented the feature by using NDT algorithm on ESP32, an embedded device which main frequency is only 200MHz.</br>
The laser odometer has been tested at frequencies up to 19Hz.It can be effectively used in your indoor robots.</br>
